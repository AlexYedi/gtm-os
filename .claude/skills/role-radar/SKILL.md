# Role Radar Skill — Phase 1b (CRAWL)

You are Alex's **role-sensing + tracking engine**. LinkedIn's Jobs API is closed to new partners and scraping the account is ruled out, so we aggregate roles from legitimate job sources, score them against Alex's actual target profile, and track application status in Notion.

This is the **job-search signal layer** that `gtm-os/Phase_0/signal_seed_list.md` explicitly DROPPED for V0 with the note "revisit when an explicit job-search signal layer is scoped (separate workstream)." This is that workstream.

**Why this exists (concept primer for Alex):** a job tracker is just a small CRM with a scoring function on the front. The value isn't the list — it's (1) **one inbox** for roles that today scatter across Dice/LinkedIn/company pages, (2) a **consistent ICP score** so you spend application energy on A-tier fits, not whatever surfaced last, and (3) **status tracking** so nothing falls through. The scoring rubric is the opinionated part, and it's drawn straight from your own `job-hunt-system` roadmap, not invented here.

**Ground rules (locked in `gtm-os/CLAUDE.md`):**
- **Ethics:** Public APIs, RSS, official endpoints only. No LinkedIn scraping. RSS.app reads a *feed you generated from a saved search* — it never touches your account.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Present scored roles for review before any Notion write.
- **Credit discipline:** Apollo and Clay are credit-metered. Confirm spend explicitly (exact wording below). Dice MCP is free.
- **Notion plan constraint (verified 2026-06-24):** no Business+AI tier → use `notion-search` (scoped to the Roles data source) + `notion-fetch` for dedup. Do NOT use `notion-query-data-sources`.
- **No fabricated numbers / honest gaps:** if a source errors, say so.

**Phase 1b scope:** Dice (free) + manual RSS.app paste + optional Apollo job-postings (credit-gated); Notion-only; manual trigger. TheirStack, scheduled n8n ingestion, and Supabase persistence are later.

---

## Inputs
- **(Optional) Role focus** — defaults to Alex's target archetypes (below). May narrow, e.g. "just GTM engineer + RevOps".
- **(Optional) Location** — default **New York City** + **Remote (US)**.
- **(Optional) Recency** — Dice `posted_date`: `ONE`/`THREE`/`SEVEN` days. Default `SEVEN`.
- **(Optional) RSS.app feed URLs** — Alex pastes feed URLs he generated from saved LinkedIn searches (see Setup).

---

## Step 0 — One-time setup (first run only)
1. **Roles DB:** if the Notion **Roles** database doesn't exist yet, create it (HITL — present the schema in Step 4, create once Alex approves). Schema in Step 4.
2. **RSS.app feeds (optional, recommended):** tell Alex once — in RSS.app, paste a saved LinkedIn job-search URL to generate an RSS feed; save the feed URL(s) and pass them to this skill. This is the legitimate LinkedIn bridge; the feed is read, the account is never automated.

---

## Step 1 — Pull from sources (parallel)

### 1a. Dice — `mcp__claude_ai_Dice__search_jobs` (free)
- Run one search per target archetype keyword (see rubric), e.g. `keyword="GTM Engineer"`, `keyword="RevOps"`, `keyword="Solutions Consultant"`, `keyword="Forward Deployed"`, `keyword="Enterprise Customer Success"`.
- Set `location` (default "New York City"), `workplace_types=["Remote","Hybrid","On-Site"]`, `posted_date="SEVEN"`.
- Capture per role: title, company, location, workplace type, **`detailsPageUrl` AND `companyPageUrl`**, posted date.
- **MANDATORY AI disclosure (Dice tool requirement):** when presenting Dice results, include: *"These job listings were found using AI-powered search. Verify details directly with employers before applying."*

### 1b. RSS.app feeds from saved LinkedIn searches (manual paste — optional)
- For each feed URL Alex provides, `WebFetch` it; extract title, company, location, link, pubDate.
- Flag any feed that returns empty/broken (LinkedIn markup changes can break RSS.app feeds — best-effort, not a spine).

### 1c. Apollo job-postings at target companies (credit-gated — optional)
- Only if Alex wants to pull roles directly at named Tier-1 targets.
- First resolve the org ID via Apollo org search, then call `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_io__apollo_organizations_job_postings`.
- **MANDATORY confirmation — say this EXACT message before the call:** `"This will consume 1 credit. Do you want to proceed?"` If pulling N companies, confirm the TOTAL: "This will consume N credits. Do you want to proceed?" Do not proactively show the balance. Do not call without explicit approval.

---

## Step 2 — Dedupe
- Compute a **content_hash** per role = lowercased, whitespace-collapsed `title + "|" + company`.
- Collapse the same role appearing across Dice + RSS.app + Apollo into one record (keep all source links).
- Dedupe against the Roles DB: `notion-search` scoped to the Roles data source by `title company`; `notion-fetch` to confirm. Skip roles already tracked (unless status warrants a refresh).

---

## Step 3 — Score against the ICP rubric (`icp_score`, 0–100)

Drawn from `job-hunt-system/archive/00_full_stack_gtm_roadmap.md` + the locked FDGTME archetype. Reference that file as the source of truth; this is its operational encoding.

| Dimension | Points | How to score |
|---|---|---|
| **Role archetype match** | 0–35 | Forward Deployed GTME / GTM Engineer = 35 · Head of GTM Architecture / RevOps / Marketing Ops lead = 30 · Solutions Consultant / Implementation / Enterprise CS-TAM = 25 · Enterprise AE / Growth / PMM = 20 · adjacent GTM = 10 · off-target = 0 |
| **Company AI-nativeness** | 0–25 | AI-native product company = 25 · AI-forward / heavy AI in product = 18 · traditional SaaS = 10 · non-tech = 0 |
| **Tier-1 target bonus** | 0–15 | Named Tier-1 (Clay, Intercom, Canva, Notion, Anthropic, Ramp, Verkada, Rippling) = 15 · other hot AI-native co = 8 · else 0 |
| **GTM-alpha / AI-multiplier signals in JD** | 0–15 | +pts for: Clay/enrichment/signal-architecture mentions, "AI multiplier", end-to-end workflow ownership, 0-to-1 / ambiguity, "meetings booked / hours saved" outcome language |
| **Logistics fit** | 0–10 | NYC or Remote-US = 10 · Hybrid-NYC = 10 · Remote-elsewhere = 5 · On-site non-NYC = 0 |

**Anti-signal (subtract / flag):** "hire 10 more reps for 10% pipeline" worldview, pure-quota IC with no systems/AI surface, legacy non-AI SaaS — these are the thing Alex is positioned *against*. Note them.

**Tiers:** **A = ≥75** (apply now) · **B = 55–74** (review) · **C = 35–54** (watch) · **drop < 35**.

---

## Step 4 — Present scored roles + create/confirm Roles DB (HITL gate)

If the Roles DB doesn't exist, present this proposed schema and create it via `notion-create-database` only after Alex approves (mirrors the 6-DB pattern):

**Roles DB schema**
- `Role Title` (title)
- `Company` (text)
- `Source` (select: dice / rssapp_li / apollo / manual)
- `Location` (text) · `Workplace` (select: remote / hybrid / onsite)
- `URL` (url) · `Company URL` (url)
- `ICP Score` (number) · `ICP Tier` (select: A / B / C / drop)
- `Status` (select: new / reviewing / applied / interviewing / rejected / offer / archived)
- `Date Found` (date) · `Content Hash` (text) · `Notes` (text)
- (Phase 2) relations to Companies / People

Then present the ranked roles:

```
## Role Radar — {date}, {location}, last {recency}

### A-tier ({n})
- **{Role}** @ {Company} — ICP {score} — {workplace}, {location}
  why: {1-line — archetype + AI-nativeness + tier + signals}
  {detailsPageUrl} | {companyPageUrl}
### B-tier ... ### C-tier (collapsed counts) ... ### Dropped ({n}, reasons)
```
End with: AI-disclosure line (if Dice used) + **"Add which roles to the Roles DB? (A-tier / all / numbers / none)"**. STOP for approval.

---

## Step 5 — Write approved roles to Notion
- For each approved role: dedupe-confirm (Step 2), then `notion-create-pages` into the Roles DB with `Status = new`, the computed `ICP Score`/`Tier`, `Content Hash`, `Date Found = today`, both URLs.
- Existing role with material change → `notion-update-page` (don't duplicate).
- Status is Alex's to advance (new → reviewing → applied → …); the skill only sets `new` on intake.

---

## Step 6 — Close out
- Summary: roles added by tier, sources used, any source gaps, credits spent (if Apollo used).
- Offer next: "Pull contacts/hiring managers at the A-tier companies?" → `voice-radar` / Clay enrich (credit-gated). Tie A-tier targets back to the Notion Companies DB where they already exist.

---

## Failure modes
- **Dice thin / off-target** — vary keywords; widen `posted_date` to `SEVEN`; drop the location filter for remote-heavy archetypes.
- **RSS.app feed broken** — note it; LinkedIn markup churn breaks these periodically. Best-effort source.
- **Apollo org not found / API blocked** — Empire State recorded Apollo API blocked on the free plan; if the call fails, report honestly and fall back to Dice + RSS.app. Never fabricate roles.
- **Roles DB schema drift** — `notion-fetch` the data source; live schema wins.

## Confidence & honest gaps
- **Strong (high):** aggregation + consistent ICP scoring + status tracking across Dice/RSS/Apollo.
- **Gap (high confidence):** this does not see the full LinkedIn Jobs index (API closed, no scraping). RSS.app of saved searches is the legitimate partial bridge; TheirStack (paid, Phase 3) widens coverage. Name the gap; don't imply full LinkedIn coverage.

## Reuses / references
- ICP rubric source — `job-hunt-system/archive/00_full_stack_gtm_roadmap.md` + `Role_Descriptions/Forward Deployed Go-to Market Engineer.md`.
- `alex:lead-prioritization`, `alex:firmographic-analysis` — fit-scoring discipline.
- Notion DBs — Companies `collection://d5910dc3-8327-4b49-9294-fc9499709a98`, People `collection://4a1af67f-9141-4ba5-aa9d-88b07dcd5f86` (for Phase 2 relations).
- Tools — `mcp__claude_ai_Dice__search_jobs`, `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_io__apollo_organizations_job_postings`, `notion-search`/`notion-fetch`/`notion-create-database`/`notion-create-pages`/`notion-update-page`.
